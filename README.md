### Background
The stock market has been around for hundreds of years and many trace its origins back to Amsterdam in the 1600s when the East India Trading Co used the idea to raise money to pay dividends to other investors (this is the definition of a ponzi scheme).

The stock market made its way to the US in the late 1700s but the NYSE was not founded until 1817. The United States' economy became very intertwined with the market and the first great Stock Market crash happened in August 1929 after the death of the market's creator and namesake Philip Market himself.


### Instructions
Capitol Gains allows you to see the publicly released disclosures that have been filed by memebers of the United States Congress. The app is broken up by Senate and House of Representatives. You can find any any active member or any member who has been in office in the previous six years (as this is the length that disclosures must be filed.) Seeing what members of Congress have invested in can be an important part of due diligence but *THIS IS  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE*. Always do your own due diligence and be aware that investing in stocks is inherently risky and can have serious tax implications. Please seek the counsel of a professional advisor with any questions you may have about investing.
